### (a)

Finding a maximum element quickly is better with the sorted array,
because with a max-heap you incur a cost of O(log n) to adjust the heap
after removing the first element. With the array it is O(1).

### (b)

Deleting an element quickly is faster for the max-heap _if_ we know the index
of the element, in which case it costs O(logn), whereas the sorted array costs O(n).
If we don't know the index of the element to delete, then searching for it will cost
O(n) and they will essentially be the same asymptotically.

### (c)

Forming the structure quickly is better with the max-heap, because it can be
done in O(n) time, whereas the sorted array must be sorted, costing O(nlogn).

### (d)

Finding the minimum element quickly is better with a sorted array, because
it can be done in constant time (O(1)), whereas with a max-heap we must go through
_all_ elements before we get to the minimum, which costs O(n) time.
